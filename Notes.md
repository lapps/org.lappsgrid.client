# Release Notes

## 3.0.0

The comments for the `AbstractSoapClient` said it would be deprecated in a *"future release"*, but since it uses an ancient version of Apache Axis that introduces severe security threats it was decided to remove the `AbstractSoapClient` without going through the deprecation process.
